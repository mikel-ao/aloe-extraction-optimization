🧪 Aloe Vera Bioactive Extraction Optimizer: A Circular Economy Approach💎 Project Overview & Intellectual PropertyThis project is the digital implementation of a patented extraction process (of which I am a co-inventor) designed to valorize Aloe vera processing by-products. By transforming the discarded rind—often a waste in the gel industry—into a high-value cosmetic ingredient, this work bridges the gap between Circular Bioeconomy and Data Science.The model is based on the research published in:Añibarro-Ortega, M., et al. (2021). Extraction of Aloesin from Aloe vera Rind Using Alternative Green Solvents: Process Optimization and Biological Activity Assessment. Biology, 10(10), 951. https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10100951🌿 Scientific BackgroundThe industrial processing of Aloe vera (L.) Burm. f. generates vast amounts of rind as a byproduct. However, this rind is a rich source of aloesin, a C-glycosylated chromone with potent anti-tyrosinase activity.Key Innovations:Green Chemistry: Replacement of traditional organic solvents with "Generally Recognized as Safe" (GRAS) alternative solvents: Ethanol, Propylene Glycol, and Glycerol.Target Bioactivity: The resulting extracts are optimized for skin-depigmenting formulations due to their high phenolic content and enzyme-inhibiting properties.Digital Scalability: This app uses Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Reduced Cubic Models to predict yields, allowing for precise industrial scale-up without further trial-and-error.📊 Technical MethodologyThe optimization was performed using a Central Composite Circumscribed Design (CCRD). The application models the interaction of three critical process variables:Time ($t$): 10–210 minTemperature ($T$): 25–95 °CSolvent Concentration ($S$): 0–100 % (w/v)Optimization Table (Validated Models)Solvent SystemTime (min)Temp (°C)Solvent (%)Max Yield (mg/g)R2Ethanol/Water59.056.40.045.440.968Propylene Glycol/Water10.090.70.061.330.596Glycerol/Water10.025.08.259.260.650🚀 Business & Industrial ImpactWaste Valorization: Converts a low-cost byproduct into a high-margin cosmetic active.Sustainability (ESG): Reduces environmental footprint by using eco-friendly solvents and optimizing energy consumption (Time/Temperature).Proven Innovation: The underlying process is patented, ensuring a unique competitive advantage in the dermocosmetic market.🛠️ Tech StackPython 3.xStreamlit (Interactive UI)Statsmodels (OLS Regression & Cubic Modeling)Plotly (3D Surface Visualization)
