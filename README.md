## 💎 Project Overview & Intellectual Property
This project showcases the digital transformation of a **patented extraction process** (of which I am a co-inventor) designed to valorize *Aloe vera* processing by-products. By applying **Circular Economy** principles, we transform discarded Aloe rind into a high-value cosmetic ingredient.

### Key Innovations:
* **Patented Technology:** Co-inventor of the industrial method for standardized aloesin extraction.
   🔗 [**Open Patent**](https://bibliotecadigital.ipb.pt/entities/publication/8920c345-be5f-428e-a336-db9ca26c4b81)
* **Green Chemistry:** Optimized use of "Generally Recognized as Safe" (GRAS) alternative solvents: Ethanol, Propylene Glycol, and Glycerol.
* **Target Bioactivity:** Extracts optimized for skin-depigmenting formulations due to their potent **anti-tyrosinase activity**.

## 🌿 Scientific Background
The industrial processing of *Aloe vera* (L.) Burm. f. generates vast amounts of rind as a byproduct. This project uses **Response Surface Methodology (RSM)** to bridge the gap between laboratory research and industrial application.

## 📊 Technical Methodology
The optimization was performed using a Central Composite Circumscribed Design (CCRD) to maximize the recovery of Aloesin, which was precisely quantified using HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS^n.

Target Response:
Aloesin Content: Measured in mg/g of extract.

Process Variables:
1. **Time** ($t$): 10–210 min
2. **Temperature** ($T$): 25–95 °C
3. **Solvent Concentration** ($S$): 0–100 % (w/w)

### Validated Optimization Models
| Solvent System | Time (min) | Temp (°C) | Solvent (%) | Max Yield_{pred} (mg/L) | Max Yield_{exp} (mg/L) | $R^2_{adj}$ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Ethanol/Water** | 92.9 | 55.9 | 0.0 | 48 $\pm$ 1 | 51 $\pm$ 1 | 0.9862 |
| **Propylene Glycol/Water** | 12.0 | 60.6 | 51.1 | 63 $\pm$ 1 | 65 $\pm$ 1 | 0.8976 |
| **Glycerol/Water** | 42.2 | 56.8 | 17.5 | 57 $\pm$ 1 | 61 $\pm$ 1 | 0.8699 |

## 🚀 Business & Industrial Impact
