## 💎 Project Overview & Intellectual Property
This project showcases the digital transformation of a **patented extraction process** (of which I am a co-inventor) designed to valorize *Aloe vera* processing by-products. By applying **Circular Economy** principles, we transform discarded Aloe rind into a high-value cosmetic ingredient.

### Key Innovations:
* **Patented Technology:** Co-inventor of the industrial method for standardized aloesin extraction.
   🔗 [**Open Patent**](https://bibliotecadigital.ipb.pt/entities/publication/8920c345-be5f-428e-a336-db9ca26c4b81)
* **Green Chemistry:** Optimized use of "Generally Recognized as Safe" (GRAS) alternative solvents: Ethanol, Propylene Glycol, and Glycerol.
* **Target Bioactivity:** Extracts optimized for skin-depigmenting formulations due to their potent **anti-tyrosinase activity**.

## 🌿 Scientific Background
The industrial processing of *Aloe vera* (L.) Burm. f. generates vast amounts of rind as a byproduct. This project uses **Response Surface Methodology (RSM)** to bridge the gap between laboratory research and industrial application.

## 📊 Technical Methodology
The optimization was performed using a **Central Composite Circumscribed Design (CCRD)**. The application models the interaction of three critical process variables:
1. **Time** ($t$): 10–210 min
2. **Temperature** ($T$): 25–95 °C
3. **Solvent Concentration** ($S$): 0–100 % (w/v)

### Validated Optimization Models
| Solvent System | Time (min) | Temp (°C) | Solvent (%) | Max Yield (mg/g) | $R^2$ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Ethanol/Water** | 59.0 | 56.4 | 0.0 | 45.44 | 0.968 |
| **Propylene Glycol/Water** | 10.0 | 90.7 | 0.0 | 61.33 | 0.596 |
| **Glycerol/Water** | 10.0 | 25.0 | 8.2 | 59.26 | 0.650 |

## 🚀 Business & Industrial Impact
* **Waste Valorization:** Converts a low-cost byproduct into a high-margin cosmetic active.
* **Cost Reduction:** Identifies precise T/t thresholds to optimize ROI and energy consumption.
* **Proven Innovation:** Based on a patented process, ensuring a unique competitive advantage.
